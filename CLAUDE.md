# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## About This Project

A full-stack aviation maintenance Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) web application for managing dynamic audit templates, task assignment, inspections, findings, and work packages.

**Status:** Phase 6 (Findings System) — ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT (Phase 5 fully complete)

---

## NEXT.JS 15 WARNING

This project uses **Next.js 15** which has breaking changes from prior versions. APIs, conventions, and file structure may differ from training data. Before writing any frontend code, read the relevant guide in `frontend/node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Heed deprecation notices.

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES — READ BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE

Violating any of these rules silently breaks data integrity, compliance, or RBAC. No exceptions.

1. **Plan before coding.** List every file you will change and what you will do. For DB migrations, describe exactly what changes and confirm it is reversible. Wait for explicit approval before proceeding.
2. **Soft delete filter — MANDATORY.** `User`, `Task`, `Finding`, `WorkPackage` are NEVER physically deleted. Every Prisma query on these models MUST include `where: { deletedAt: null }`. No exceptions — every controller, every endpoint.
3. **Dual write — MANDATORY.** Every status change or significant event writes to BOTH `AuditLog` (compliance) AND `TaskActivity` (`SYSTEM_EVENT`). Never one without the other.
4. **Draft encapsulation.** On Template publish, ALWAYS set `draftSchema: null`. Never mutate `formSchema` of a Published template — edits go to `draftSchema` only.
5. **Schema snapshot.** Every Task stores `schemaSnapshot` (copy of `formSchema`) at creation time. Never render a Task form from the live Template `formSchema`.
6. **RBAC — Task review rights.** Approve / Reject / Follow-up = Issuer + Director + Managers of same Division only. Not Issuer alone. Not all Managers.
7. **Reassignment.** Permitted at any non-final stage, mandatory reason, all TaskData preserved. BLOCKED on Closed, Terminated, Rejected.
8. **Test DB isolation.** Tests ALWAYS run against `sqd_qa_test_db`. Never `sqd_qa_db`. Confirm `.env.test` is loaded before running tests.
9. **Prisma generate.** Run `npx prisma generate` in `/backend` after every `schema.prisma` change.
10. **File Upload deferred.** Do not implement File Upload field type until MinIO is configured (Phase 5.4+). Never hardcode file size/type limits — Admin-configurable only.
11. **Terminal — cmd only.** Always use cmd syntax. Never PowerShell syntax (`$env:VAR`, backtick line continuation, etc.).
12. **Update `CLAUDE_HANDOVER.md` after every completed feature.** Once the user confirms a feature is complete and all tests pass, update `CLAUDE_HANDOVER.md` — phase status, completed items, test count, new gotchas. Do this before ending the session. Never update it before the user confirms completion.

## QUICK START

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, PostgreSQL (`sqd_qa_db` dev · `sqd_qa_test_db` tests · both on port 5432)

```cmd
REM Terminal 1 — Frontend (http://localhost:3000)
cd frontend && npm run dev

REM Terminal 2 — Backend (http://localhost:5000)
cd backend && npm run dev
```

**Master user:** `director@sqd.com` / `password123` (Director role)

---

## CRITICAL REFERENCE DOCUMENTS

Read these before touching code — they supersede this file:

1. **`CLAUDE_HANDOVER.md`** — Absolute source of truth: roadmap, architecture decisions, full object reference, schema, RBAC rules, security fixes. Read Section 10 ("BEFORE STARTING ANY NEW FEATURE") first.
2. **`BUSINESS_WORKFLOW.md`** — Human-readable workflow rules: templates, work packages, task execution, findings loop, data visibility.

---

## TECHNOLOGY STACK

**Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19), Tailwind CSS v4, Zustand (auth state), Axios, TypeScript 5 strict, ESLint 9

**Backend:** Express.js 5, Node.js, TypeScript 6 strict (ES2020/commonjs), Prisma ORM v7 + `@prisma/adapter-pg`, Jest 30 + Supertest

**Database:** PostgreSQL — `sqd_qa_db` (dev), `sqd_qa_test_db` (tests)

---

## AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

- JWT tokens (`JWT_SECRET` env var), bcrypt password hashing, session tracking via `activeSessionId` UUID
- Test mode: `ENFORCE_SINGLE_SESSION=false` in `.env.test`

**Role hierarchy (highest → lowest):** Director → Admin → Manager → Group Leader → Staff
- Director: global access, assign to anyone, review globally
- Manager: division-scoped; assign/review within division
- Group Leader: create/assign tasks in assigned WPs (division-scoped)
- Staff: perform assigned tasks; self-assign unassigned tasks

Privilege rules hardcoded in Phase 5; database-driven in Phase 7 via `PrivilegeConfig` model.

---

## KEY ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS

**Draft Encapsulation** — Published template edits go to `draftSchema` only; never exposed to non-owners. Clear `draftSchema` to null on publish.

**Schema Snapshots** — Tasks store immutable `schemaSnapshot` at creation. Form rendering always uses the snapshot, never the live Template `formSchema`.

**Soft Delete** — All deletes set `deletedAt`, never physical removal (aviation compliance). Always filter `where: { deletedAt: null }`.

**Status Machines:**
- Template: Draft → Published → Archived
- Task: 10-status lifecycle (see `CLAUDE_HANDOVER.md`)
- Finding: Open → In Progress → Pending Verification → Closed
- WorkPackage: Open → In Progress → Overdue / Closed / Inactive

**Dual Audit:** `AuditLog` (system-wide compliance) + `TaskActivity` (per-task operational feed) — always both on every status change.

---

## RUNNING TESTS

```cmd
cd backend
npm run test:setup
npm run test
npm run test -- auth.test.ts
```

Always targets `sqd_qa_test_db` (Rule 8). Database wiped in `beforeEach`. All 150 tests must pass before and after every change.

---

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

**Backend** (`.env`):
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/sqd_qa_db"
JWT_SECRET="super-secret-development-key-12345"
ENFORCE_SINGLE_SESSION=true
```
**Frontend:** auto-connects to `http://localhost:5000`

---

## COMMON COMMANDS

> cmd syntax only — never PowerShell

```cmd
REM Database
cd backend && npx prisma generate
cd backend && npx prisma db push
cd backend && npx prisma db seed

REM Lint
cd frontend && npm run lint

REM Production build
cd frontend && npm run build && npm run start
```

## SECURITY NOTES (DEFERRED — implement before production)

Audited 2026-05-29. See `CLAUDE_HANDOVER.md` Section 11 for detailed fixes:
1. `updatePassword` — missing current-password verification
2. `forgotPassword` — allows user enumeration (404 on unknown email)
3. No rate limiting on `/login` and `/forgot-password`
4. JWT secret falls back to weak default
5. Reset tokens stored plaintext

---

## BEFORE STARTING ANY FEATURE

1. Re-read **NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES** above.
2. Read `CLAUDE_HANDOVER.md` Sections 1, 2, 3, 6, and 10.
3. Plan every file change, get approval before touching code (Rule 1).
4. Run `cd backend && npm run test` — confirm 150 pass as baseline.
5. After user confirms completion, update `CLAUDE_HANDOVER.md` (Rule 12).
